                    <h3>Beginning :</h3>
                    <p>The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868,
                        originally as "The All England Croquet Club". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple
                        Road, Wimbledon.</p>
                    <p>
                        In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier as
                        an outdoor version of real tennis and originally given the name Sphairistikè, was added to the
                        activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed "The All England Croquet and Lawn
                        Tennis Club" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship.
                        A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up
                        for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and
                        posts and the distance of the service line from the net.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was
                        the only event held. 22 men paid a guinea to enter the tournament, which was to be held over
                        five days. The rain delayed it four more days and thus, on 19 July 1877, the final was played.
                        Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, defeated William Marshall 6–1, 6–2 and 6–4 in 48
                        minutes. Gore was presented with the silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas and donated by
                        the sports magazine The Field, as well as a prize money of 12 guineas. About 200 spectators paid
                        one shilling each to watch the final.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the
                        others arranged around it, hence the title "Centre Court".The name was retained when the Club
                        moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its
                        location.[14] However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of
                        the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described. The opening of the
                        new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.

                    <h3>21st Century :</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wimbledon is widely considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the
                        club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended
                        to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours. Stage one
                        (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new
                        No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the
                        hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the
                        old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive
                        facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the
                        Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) was completed with the construction
                        of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that
                        rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on Centre Court. The Club tested the new roof at an
                        event called A Centre Court Celebration on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition
                        matches involving Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Kim Clijsters, and Tim Henman. The first
                        Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's
                        singles match between Dinara Safina and Amélie Mauresmo. The first match to be played in its
                        entirety under the new roof took place between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka on 29 June
                        2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which
                        ended at 11:02 pm in a victory over Marcos Baghdatis at Centre Court in the third round of the
                        2012 Championships. The 2012 Gentlemen's Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between Roger Federer and
                        Murray, was the first singles final to be partially played under the roof, which was activated
                        during the third set.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new 4,000-seat No. 2 Court was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009
                        Championships. A new 2,000-seat No. 3 Court was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3
                        Courts.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 1 August 2011, the All England Club transferred all of its assets relating to The
                        Championships to a separate though wholly owned subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club
                        (Championships) Limited, also known as AELTC. Since that time, the club's activities have been
                        formally conducted separately from those of The Championships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2012, the All England Club hosted the Summer Olympic Games and became the first Olympic grass
                        court tournament since tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport and the first to be held at a
                        Grand Slam venue in the Open era.

                            <h2>Traditions :</h2>
                            <p>Social commentator Ellis Cashmore describes Wimbledon as having "a David Niven-ish
                                propriety", in trying to conform to the standards of behaviour regarded as common in the
                                1950s. Writer Peter York sees the event as representing a particular white, upper middle
                                class, affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as "a southern,
                                well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character". Cashmore has
                                criticised the event for being "remote and insulated" from the changing multicultural
                                character of modern Britain, describing it as "nobody's idea of all-things-British".</p>

                            <h2>Ball boys and ball girls :</h2>
                            <p>In the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBGs, have a brief that a good
                                BBG "should not be seen. They should blend into the background and get on with their
                                jobs quietly.</p>
                            <p>
                                From 1947 ball boys were recruited from Goldings, the only Barnardos school to
                                provide them. Prior to this, from the 1920s onwards, the ball boys came from The
                                Shaftesbury Children's Home.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since 1969, BBGs have been drawn from local schools. Traditionally, Wandsworth Boys
                                School in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on West Hill in
                                Wandsworth (only Southfields remains extant), were the schools of choice for selection
                                of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have
                                been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of Merton, Sutton, Kingston, and
                                Wandsworth, as well as from Surrey. BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from
                                the school years nine and ten. They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five
                                tournaments, up to year thirteen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prospective BBGs are first nominated by their school headteacher, to be considered for
                                selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis,
                                and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary
                                instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in
                                February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008,
                                this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical,
                                procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert,
                                self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the
                                Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and
                                then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships to ensure that
                                BBGs gain a feel of the grass court

                                 <p>At The Championships at Wimbledon, forty-two chair umpires are assigned each day and usually work two matches a day. They use tablet computers to score each match and these scores are displayed on the scoreboards and on wimbledon.com. Line umpires work in teams of nine or seven. Teams of nine umpires work the Centre Court and Court numbers 1, 2, 3, 12, and 18 with the remaining teams of seven working the other courts. These teams rotate, working sixty minutes on the court and then sixty minutes off. In 2007 a new technology called Hawk-Eye was introduced. This technology determines whether the ball bounces in bounds or out. Wimbledon has started using this technology but continues to use line umpires as well.</p>

                                 <p>Dark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours. However, all tennis players participating in the tournament are required to wear all-white or at least almost all-white clothing, a long-time tradition at Wimbledon. Wearing white clothing with some colour accents is also acceptable, provided the colour scheme is not that of an identifiable commercial brand logo (the outfitter's brand logo being the sole exception). Controversy followed Martina Navratilova's wearing branding for "Kim" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer Ralph Lauren.</p>

                                 <p>Previously, players bowed or curtsied to members of the royal family seated in the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court. However, in 2003, All England Club president Prince Edward, Duke of Kent decided to discontinue the tradition. Now, players are required to bow or curtsy only if the Prince of Wales or the King is present, as was in practice during the 2010 Championships when Elizabeth II was in attendance at Wimbledon on 24 June. On 27 June 2012, Roger Federer said in his post-match interview that he and his opponent had been asked to bow towards the Royal Box as Prince Charles and his wife were present, saying that it was not a problem for him.</p>
